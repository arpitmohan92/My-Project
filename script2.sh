Plan Resource Requirements: Assess the computing power, storage, and networking needs before launching an instance.
Follow Naming Conventions: Adhere to naming conventions for easy identification and management of resources.
Implement Security Groups: Define appropriate security groups to restrict access to necessary ports and protocols.
Apply Tags: Tag instances with relevant metadata such as owner, purpose, and environment for better organization and cost tracking.
Enable Monitoring: Enable CloudWatch monitoring for the instance to monitor performance and health.
Regular Updates: Keep the instance updated with the latest security patches and software updates.
Back Up Data: Implement regular backups of important data stored on the instance to prevent data loss.
Implement IAM Roles: Assign IAM roles with the least privilege principle to instances to restrict access to AWS resources.
Don'ts:

Ignore Security Best Practices: Avoid launching instances without implementing necessary security measures like encryption and access controls.
Use Default Settings Blindly: Don't rely on default settings; customize configurations based on organizational requirements.
Forget to Terminate Unused Instances: Avoid leaving instances running when they are no longer needed to save costs.
Share Key Pairs: Don't share key pairs used to access instances with unauthorized individuals.
Ignore Compliance Requirements: Ensure compliance with organizational and regulatory requirements when configuring instances.
Overprovision Resources: Avoid overprovisioning resources by selecting instance types that match workload requirements.
Store Sensitive Data Without Encryption: Don't store sensitive data on instances without proper encryption measures in place.
Neglect Monitoring: Don't neglect monitoring and managing instances after launch; regularly review performance and security.
