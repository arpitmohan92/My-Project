I am trying to identify the source of traffic to the following Trip API endpoint:

https://api.vacloud.io/trip/v1/departure/info

Specifically I'm looking for the source DNS to try and identify what systems may be calling this endpoint.

Are you able to retrieve this information via Cloudwatch? I'd need a maximum of 30 days worth of connectivity. If you don't have this much history, whatever you have is fine.
