Presentation Tier (Web Tier):
This tier is responsible for interacting with users and presenting the user interface.
It often involves a web server, which could be an EC2 instance running a web server software like Apache or Nginx.
In a VPC diagram, this tier might reside in a public subnet, allowing direct access from the internet.
Application Tier (Logic Tier):
The application tier processes business logic and executes the core functionality of the application.
It can include multiple servers or instances running application code, which could be hosted on EC2 instances or within containers managed by AWS ECS (Elastic Container Service).
In a VPC diagram, this tier might reside in a private subnet, limiting direct external access and enhancing security.
Data Tier (Database Tier):
The data tier stores and manages the application's data.
It often involves a database server, which could be an Amazon RDS instance for a relational database or an Amazon DynamoDB table for a NoSQL database.
In a VPC diagram, this tier might also reside in a private subnet to restrict direct access and enhance security.
VPC Configuration:

The entire architecture operates within an AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), providing network isolation and control.
Subnets are used to organize resources. Public subnets may contain resources that need direct internet access, while private subnets house resources that should not be directly accessible from the internet.
Security Groups and Network ACLs are configured to control inbound and outbound traffic between different tiers. For example, only allowing necessary traffic from the web tier to the application tier.
